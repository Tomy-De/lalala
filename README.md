Investigating repetition in pop music. Interested in questions like:

- Has pop music been getting more (or less) repetitive over time?
- Which songs/artists/genres are the most/least repetitive?

I'm measuring repetitiveness of a song by how well gzip can compress it. (Which sounds cheeky, but I think it can actually be justified when you look at how Lempel-Ziv compression works.)

Code is a mess right now - sorry.
